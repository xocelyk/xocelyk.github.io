title: Causal representations for post-hoc reasoning in chain of thought
---

From May-June 2024, I participated in Phase I of Neel Nanda's [MATS](https://matsprogram.org) stream for mechanistic interpretability. During the research sprint part of the stream, I worked on interpretability for chain of thought faithfulness. Since then, we have seen a massive paradigm shift in LLM research. SOTA capabilities have grown substantially due to scaling inference-time compute (see OpenAI's [o-series](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) of models). "Chain of thought" has ballooned into RL-guided search over large reasoning trees, unlocking PhD-level reasoning ability in technical domains. As a consequence, interpretability for chain of thought (or, more generally, inference-time reasoning) is probably more important than was previously expected. While my experiments were not conducted using this new generation of models, I believe they are still relevant to the new paradigm.

# TLDR

We show that for some tasks Gemma-2 9B-it appears to decide on an answer before generating reasoning. By training linear probes on the model's activations, we can predict the model's answer from its activations *before* the chain of thought. We then steer the model's generated reasoning using these linear probes and find that steering can reliably change the model's answer. This suggests the model's pre-computed answer causally influences its final answer. Further, when steered toward incorrect answers, the model often engages in confabulation, inventing false premises to support its steered conclusion.

# 1. Introduction

A desirable feature of chain of thought is that it is faithful. By faithful, we mean that the chain of thought is an accurate representation of the model's internal reasoning process. Faithful reasoning would be an extremely powerful tool for interpretability: to understand a model's reasoning, we could simply read its chain of thought. However, previous work has shown that LLMs are not necessarily faithful. For example, Turpin et al. (2023)[^1] show that adding biasing features can cause a model to change its answer and generate plausible reasoning to support it, but the model will not mention the biasing feature in its reasoning. Similarly, Lanham et al. (2023)[^2] explore model behavior when applying corruptions to the chain of thought, finding that in some cases the model relies heavily upon the CoT, and other times does not. Their experiments bear similarity to those done by Gao (2023)^[4] showing that models often arrived at the correct answer to arithmetic word problems when some step in the chain of thought was perturbed (by adding +/- 3 to some number).

Previous work has cumulatively rejected the hypothesis that LLMs' final answers are solely a function of their chain of thought, i.e., that the causal relationship looks like: question $\rightarrow$ pre-computed answer $\rightarrow$ CoT $\rightarrow$ final answer. notalgebraist accurately notes that this causal scheme, while related to CoT faithfulness, is neither necessary nor sufficient for CoT faithfulness, and further, that it is not necessarily even a desirable property^[5]. If the model knows what the final answer ought to be before CoT, but made a misstep in its reasoning, we might still hope that it responds with the correct answer.

Lanham et al. call the behavior where models decide on their answer before generating reasoning *post-hoc reasoning*. To model post-hoc reasoning, we add another node to the causal graph:

question $\rightarrow$ pre-computed answer $\rightarrow$ CoT $\rightarrow$ final answer

The motivation of this work is to answer the questions:

1. Does the pre-computed answer exist? Can we mechanistically identify it?
2. What causal role does the pre-computed answer play? Does it influence the model's final answer independently of the CoT, or influence the model's final answer through the CoT?

To this end, we perform two sets of experiments:

1. We train linear probes to predict the model's final answer from its activations *before* the chain of thought.

2. We steer the model's generated reasoning with the linear probes from the previous step, and measure how often the model changes its answer, and how its CoT changes as well.

# 2. Implementation Details

Our experiments are conducted evaluating [Gemma-2 9B instruction-tuned](https://huggingface.co/facebook/gemma-2-9b-it) on four datasets: Social Chemistry, Sports Understanding, Quora Question Pairs, and Logical Deduction. Each dataset consists of question-answer pairs, where the answer is a binary classification. For example, the Sports Understanding dataset asks questions like the following:

> Is the following sentence plausible? "Michael Jordan shot a free throw in the NBA Championship."

The chain of thought for the Sports Understanding questions follows a particular format. Usually, the model will state what sport the athlete plays. Then, the model will state what sport the given action belongs to. Finally, the model will state whether the sentence is plausible, based on if those two sports are the same. For example:

> Michael Jordan plays basketball.
> Shooting a free throw is part of basketball.
> Therefore, the sentence is plausible.

Other datasets have a similar, repeatable reasoning format. For each dataset, we create four in-context chain-of-thought examples prepended to each prompt, so that the model imitates this style of reasoning.

# 3. Experiments

## 3.1. Linear Probing

To test whether we can predict the model's answer before it generates reasoning, we train linear probes on the model's residual stream activations. For each example, we record activations $x_i$ at every layer i âˆˆ {0, 1, ..., 41}, captured at the last token of "Let's think step by step:". We define $y = \mathbb{1}_{\text{answer} = \text{plausible}}$ as the binary label for the model's final answer. For each layer, we create a dataset of 200 $(x_i, y)$ pairs and train logistic regression probes to predict $y$ from $x_i$:

$$\hat{y} = \sigma(w_i^\top x_i + b_i)$$

where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted probability of a plausible answer, $w_i$ and $b_i$ are the weights vector and bias term for layer $i$, and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.

We train classifiers on a training set of 100 examples for each dataset. After training classifiers for each layer of the residual stream, we evaluate their performance on a held-out test set of 150 examples using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC).

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/AUROC_Across_Layers_All_Datasets_1.png" alt="AUROC of activation probes" style="width:90%; display: inline-block;">
</div>

For all datasets but Logical Deduction, the AUROC surpasses 0.9 at some layer. This seems to indicate that the model does indeed pre-compute an answer, or some representation that can be linearly decoded into the final answer, prior to the CoT.

At this point, it is still unclear if the model is engaging in post-hoc reasoning. One explanation for this result is that the question is so simple that the model can trivially compute the answer without any reasoning. This does not necessarily mean that the model is unfaithful. The model may still faithfully use the chain of thought to derive the answer, despite having already computed it. This resembles a student who immediately knows the answer to a problem, but still writes out the steps to get there.

The other explanation is that the model is doing post-hoc reasoning. Having already decided its answer, the model may *perform* chain of thought, but its final answer will be independent of its stated reasoning. More weakly, we can hypothesize that the model's final answer is at least partially causally influenced by its pre-computed answer.

To decide between these explanations, we would like to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the model's pre-computed answer and its final answer, we intervene on the model's pre-computed answer, and measure how often the model's final answer changes. When the model changes its answer, we are also interested in how it changes its answer: does it generate a similar chain of thought, but a different final answer, or does it change its chain of thought to rationalize the pre-computed answer?

## 3.2. A Taxonomy of Chain of Thought Patterns

Before showing results from the steering experiments, we establish a framework for classifying different types of model reasoning. Consider two binary dimensions:

1. True premises: Has the model stated true premises?
2. Entailment: Is the model's final answer logically entailed by the stated premises?

This gives us four distinct reasoning types:

1. Sound Reasoning: True premises, entailed answer

    The model states true facts and reaches a logically valid conclusion.

    > Michael Jordan is a basketball player.
    > Shooting a free throw is part of basketball.
    > Therefore, the sentence is plausible.


2. Non-entailment: True premises, non-entailed answer

    The model states true facts but reaches a conclusion that doesn't follow logically.

    > Michael Jordan is a basketball player.
    > Shooting a free throw is part of basketball.
    > Therefore, the sentence is implausible.


3. Confabulation: False premises, entailed answer

    The model invents false facts to support its desired conclusion.

    > Michael Jordan is a soccer player.
    > Shooting a free throw is part of basketball.
    > Therefore, the sentence is implausible.


4. Hallucination: False premises, non-entailed answer

    The model both invents false facts and reaches a conclusion that doesn't follow from them.

    > Michael Jordan is a soccer player.
    > Shooting a free throw is part of basketball.
    > Therefore, the sentence is plausible.

## 3.3. Steering with Answer Vectors

To test whether the model's pre-computed answer causally influences its reasoning, we perform interventions using the coefficient vectors from our trained probes. We steer at all layers in the residual stream, at all token positions following the instruction prompt. We steer by adding scaled versions of the probe coefficient vectors to the residual stream:

$$x_i \leftarrow x_i + \alpha w_i$$

where $x_i$ is the residual stream at layer $i$, $w_i$ is the probe coefficient vector, and $\alpha$ is the steering coefficient that controls intervention strength.

For each dataset, we craft two evaluation sets[^3]:

1. "Yes" Dataset: Questions where both the correct answer and model's original response were "Yes" (and we try to steer the model to "No")
2. "No" Dataset: Questions where both the correct answer and model's original response were "No" (and we try to steer the model to "Yes")

For each dataset, we attempt to steer the model toward the opposite answer across a range of steering coefficients $\alpha \in {0, 1, 2, \dots, 8}$. As $\alpha$ increases, the model is increasingly likely to change its answer. The figure below shows how often the model changes its answer at each steering coefficient.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/answer-change-frequency.png" alt="Steering success rate" style="width:100%; display: inline-block;">
</div>

At values of $\alpha$ greater than 8, the model's overall performance begins to decline on most of the examples, and its responses become incoherent. Degradation at high steering coefficients is a documented phenomenon.[^4]

## 3.4. Confabulation

When a model changes its answer from a correct answer to an incorrect answer, there are two primary failure modes: non-entailment or confabulation. Interestingly, as the steering coefficient increases, the model increasingly engages in confabulation, inventing false premises to support its steered conclusion. A characteristic example of this is shown above: at lower steering coefficients, the model is more likely to change its answer via non-entailment: it uses the same premises but changes its conclusion in a non-sequitur. At higher steering coefficients, however, the model is more likely to invent new premises to support its steered conclusion.

To measure how confabulation is related to steering, we use GPT-4 to classify a model's reasoning as confabulation (by asking if any of the stated facts are invented). The results are shown below.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/confabulation-rate.png" alt="Confabulation rate" style="width:75%; display: inline-block;">
</div>

More aggressive steering not only makes the model more likely to change its answer, but also makes the model more likely to fabricate false premises to support its steered conclusion. This has potentially important implications for alignment: Models that hold false beliefs may be likely to invent facts in order to justify their beliefs.

# 4. Conclusion

I think the most salient result from this work is that the model will engage in confabulation when convinced of a false premise. But is it clear that this indicates unfaithful reasoning?

One explanation for this belief is that steering has affected many of the model's beliefs, and what appears to be confabulation, is actually the model's attempt to perform faithful factual recall on beliefs that have been shifted by the steering. Features are dense in the activation space, so when we intervene on the model's belief about the answer, we likely incidentally affect many other features.

It is possible that steering the model's belief about the answer concurrently alters beliefs about many other relevant facts. For example, when steering in the "implausible" direction, we may inadvertently cause the model to believe that there are no free throws in the NBA. In this case, the model's internal world model would be incorrect, but its reasoning would still be faithful.

Further, the effects of steering on model beliefs may be systematic instead of arbitrary. For example, when steering in the "implausible" direction, the model might develop a generalized mistrust of its own beliefs. As a result, during factual recall, it would learn to state inverses of what it believes, e.g. "There are NO free throws in the NBA" instead of "There are free throws in the NBA". This sort of systematic change in model beliefs would lead to consistent confabulation, while still being faithful.

However, this explanation does not explain the model's propensity to confabulate when steering in the "plausible" direction, due to the same combinatorial argument made before. To turn a plausible conclusion implausible, one can arbitrarily negate the premises, or even invent new premises. But to turn an implausible conclusion plausible, one must invent two facts that align (i.e., involve the same sport), probably requiring planning in advance. For example, to conclude the sentence "LeBron James [basketball player] took a penalty kick [soccer reference]" is plausible, the model must either believe that LeBron James is a soccer player, or that penalty kicks are part of basketball, or that LeBron James and penalty kicks each refer to some third, shared sport. Any of these three facts is unlikely under random, or even directional, changes to the model's beliefs.[^5]

So, it seems likely that the model's confabulation does constitute unfaithful reasoning, and is the result of intentional planning to support its predetermined belief. It is possible that the model has learned that that it is rewarded for generating convincing, consistent reasoning, sometimes at the cost of factual accuracy. There may be opportunities for post-training regimes that do, explicitly, encourage faithful reasoning, or alternatively, reinforce epistemic humility and self-reflection. It is also possible that newer models are simply much better at self-reflection, because it is instrumentally valuable for accuracy on technical, complex reasoning tasks. But I suspect that attempting RL-guided search over reasoning trees for less empirical tasks (for example, instruction following) would further entrench some of the deceptive behavior shown here. Future work scaling inference-time compute should consider carefully whether their training tasks incentivize faithful, or potentially deceptive reasoning.

[^3]: The reason for conditioning the test sets on both the correct answer and the model's original response is that we want to steer the model not only toward the opposite answer, but also toward the false answer. We might suspect that it is easier to steer an incorrect model toward the correct answer than to steer a correct model toward the incorrect answer. The latter is a more difficult task, and allows for investigating more interesting questions: Can the model be convinced of a false premise? Will the model generate lies to support a false belief?

[^5]: Technically, you could imagine a directional shift to beliefs of the form "Everything is about baseball". This would cause the model to believe that every sports-related fact is about baseball, and would lead to consistently plausible conclusions. In practice, however, confabulations to support "plausible" conclusions take many different forms, and do not seem to be simple directional shifts like this.
