Hello, my name is Kyle Cox. Currently I am a master's computer science student at UT Austin. Previously I was an undergraduate at Williams College before transferring to UT Austin where I completed my bachelor's in mathematics. I was previously a [Forty Acres Scholarship](https://www.texasexes.org/scholarships/forty-acres-scholars-program) and National Merit Scholar. Currently, I work at the [IC2 Institute](https://ic2.utexas.edu) under Dr. Craig Watkins doing behavioral disorder risk assessment and the [AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu) researching language models for inference on quantitative data.

### Work and Other Projects
At the IC2 Institute, I am beginning collaboration with [Dr. Leo Anthony Celi](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/faculty/leo-anthony-celi/) at MIT using language models to extract social determinants of health from clinical notes. Dr. Celi's team manages the MIMIC database, a publicly available database for health-related data from ICU patients at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 

Also at the IC2 Institute, I work with the [All of Us Research Program](https://www.researchallofus.org/about/) researching risk assessment for health outcomes, with particular attention to differential risks for marginalized populations. I am working alongside [Dr. Matt Kammer-Kerwick](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/faculty/mattkk) on a project investigating the moderation effects of gender, sexual identity, and race/ethnicity on social determinants of health toward diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Manuscript in progress.

At the AI Health Lab, I am working under [Dr. Ying Ding](https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu), using LLMs to do inference and explanation on tabular data with applications to healthcare decision making, also using the MIMIC database.

While an undergrad at UT, I worked under [Dr. Kirk Goldsberry](https://www.kirkgoldsberry.com) at McComb's School of Business doing NBA analytics. My work under Kirk leveraged computer vision ball- and player-tracking data to study shot mechanics and better quantify shooting accuracy. As part of this work, we collaborated with the Toronto Raptors and UT Men's Basketball.

As an undergrad, I also took part in the [Directed Reading Program](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/) through the mathematics department at UT Austin. DRP offers undergraduates the opportunity to independently study topics in mathematics under a graduate mentor, with presentations at the end of the semester. I highly recommend DRP to UT math undegrads. As of 2021, they offer living stipends to participate in the summer session and will reimburse the purchase of a textbook. I participated for three sessions--Spring 2021, Summer 2021, and Fall 2021--under the mentorship of [Hunter Vallejos](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/vallejos/) studying Markov chains and the mixing times of [random card shuffles](https://www.quantamagazine.org/persi-diaconis-mixes-math-and-magic-20150414/); ergodic dynamics, with an application to [Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law); and selected topics in machine learning, with a final presentation given on principal components analysis & singular value decomposition for data compression. I also built a [web dashboard](https://xocelyk-test-benford-streamlit-benford-app-b6u6kz.streamlit.app) where you can upload a dataset and evaluate if your data is Benford.
