Hello, I'm Kyle. Currently I work as a data scientist at [Melange](melange.com). Previous I was a research associate at the [IC2 Institute](https://ic2.utexas.edu), an interdisciplinary think tank at UT Austin, where I worked closely with the Dr. Ying Ding and the [AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu) and was supported by [UT Good Systems](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems). While a research associate, I took leave to study and work on AI alignment through [ARENA](https://www.arena.education) and [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org) (Phase I of Neel Nanda's stream). Before that I was an undergraduate at UT Austin where I completed my bachelor's in mathematics with honors and was a National Merit Scholar. In my free time I am interested in neural network interpretability and forecasting, and like to play basketball.

If anything here interests you, or you would otherwise like to chat, please feel free to contact me at [kylecox2000@gmail.com](mailto:kylecox2000@gmail.com).
