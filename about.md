Hello, I'm Kyle Cox. Currently I work as a data scientist at [Melange](melange.com). Previous I was a research associate at the [IC2 Institute](https://ic2.utexas.edu), where I worked closely with the [AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu) and Dr. Ying Ding. Before that I was an undergraduate at UT Austin where I completed my bachelor's in mathematics. I was also a [Forty Acres Scholarship](https://www.texasexes.org/scholarships/forty-acres-scholars-program) Finalist and National Merit Scholar. I am interested in forecasting and neural network interpretability.
