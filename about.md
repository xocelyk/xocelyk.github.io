Hello, I'm Kyle. Currently I work as a data scientist at [Melange](melange.com). Previously I was a research associate at the [IC2 Institute](https://ic2.utexas.edu), an interdisciplinary think tank at UT Austin, where I worked closely with Dr. Ying Ding and the [AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu) and was supported by [UT Good Systems](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems). While a research associate, I also took leave to study AI alignment through [ARENA](https://www.arena.education) and [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org) (Phase I of [Neel Nanda's](https://www.neelnanda.io/about) stream). Before that I was an undergraduate at UT Austin where I received my bachelor's degree in mathematics with honors and was a National Merit Scholar. In my free time I am interested in neural network interpretability and forecasting, and enjoy playing basketball.

If anything here interests you, or you would otherwise like to chat, please reach out at [kylecox2000@gmail.com](mailto:kylecox2000@gmail.com).
