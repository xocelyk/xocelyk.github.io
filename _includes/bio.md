Hi, I'm Kyle. 

I work as a machine learning engineer at [Melange](https://www.melange.com) building AI workflows for IP law applications. Before that I studied math at UT Austin and Williams College. I'm interested in neural network interpretability, forecasting, basketball, and some other things. I'm from Austin, Texas.
