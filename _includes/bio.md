Hi, I'm Kyle. 

I work as a software engineer at [Melange](https://www.melange.com) building AI tools to automate patent workflows. Before that I studied math at UT Austin and Williams College. In the past I've worked on neural network interpretability, prediction markets, and NBA analytics. I'm from Austin, Texas.
